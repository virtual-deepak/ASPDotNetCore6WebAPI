## ASP.NET Core Web API

A repository of fully functional Web API with latest of .NET with Visual Studio Code.

This has methodical implementation segregated into different projects focussing on below concepts of Web API to fundamentally understand them with hands-on <br>
1. CRUD
2. Dependency Injection
3. Authentication
4. Authorization
5. Versioning
6. Documentation <br>
.. and many more coming up!

This is mostly my hands-on implementation following along the [Pluralsight couse code](https://github.com/KevinDockx/AspNetCore6WebAPIFundamentals#aspnet-core-6-web-api-fundamentals).

Most welcome to contribute, raise issues, feedbacks, suggestions etc. whenever you can.<br> 

I wish to keep this as updated with most of the concepts of WebAPI as a single source to refer for fundamental knowledge.
